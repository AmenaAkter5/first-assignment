            <p class="alignment">2022 is going to be the challenging year for me. In this year I will learn full web
                development from the
                web development course offering by programming hero. I am Hablu the Great. Before enrolled this course I
                had zero
                knowledge about web development. I decided to enroll this course to start my new learning to do better
                in my life. I will not stop my journey until I become the Web Development Hero. </p>

                    I want to get chance the SCIC Club of this web development course. I know to achieve this target I
                    need to be a hard worker and committed to my work.

                <p>
                    From the definition we see that Goals are the small targets to achieve mission. So, to achieve my
                    mission I also need to accomplish some small targets such as get good marks in assignments, finish
                    the course modules on time.

                an awesome mentor. We all are grateful to him for such interesting learning environment. In school life
                I read a passage about a good teacher. This passage said that a good teacher need to be a good actor who
                catch the attention of students. I see that our mentor is that good teacher whose attributes are defined
                in that passage.We all respect him and appreciate him for his contibution to us.</p>
